>[! Organization] Might want to have a few dedicated sections for setting the frame and exploring the different theories of a particular section. 
	1. For example, a section dedicated to consciousness might be a good idea: to explore different theories of consciousness
	2. Alternatively we can lay out all of these categories at the beginning and then come back to them throughout the curriculum 


>[! Possible sections to add]
>1. Coordination between different forms of intelligence (Infraspecific and Interspecific species corredination)




>[!Section on Emerging Technology and Frontier Research]
>I think that in each section it might be a good idea to include articles recent developments, especially in technology and science, because that is why many people are interested in studying Diverse Intelligences 



For each of the sections it might be a good idea to add excepts about the part of the brain works into the section.... we can do quotes from brief history of intelligence book.
