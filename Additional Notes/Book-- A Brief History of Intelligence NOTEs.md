Here I am going to give my thoughts/things that I learned from the book.

Litmus test/Acid Test: Definitive test for something, decisive 

Abiogenesis: 

The great oxygen event (Cyanobacteria) --> leads to cellular respiration! LIFE EXPLOITS EVERYTHING! 

Maelstrom: 

Multicellularity evolved independently multiple times

The basic structure of the neuron has not changed in six-hundred million years since they first evolved: 
	-Evolution rewired them but made no meaningful change to the neurons  

> **This is a glaring example of how prior innovations impose constraints on future innovations,** often leaving early structures unchanged—the fundamental building blocks of brains have been essentially the same for over six hundred million years.
- Maybe what comes now is a new type of information processing unit --- the digital neural network 

Corals have neurons 

dendrites --> axons 
- action potentials
- Rate coding --> magnitude of sensation 

Woah. Neurons are constantly adapting their firing rate to their environment: 
>**Neurons do not have a fixed relationship between natural variables and firing rates. Instead, neurons are always adapting their firing rates to their environment**; they are constantly remapping the relationship between variables in the natural world and the language of firing rates. The term neuroscientists use to describe this observation is adaptation; this was Adrian’s third discovery.”
- This is huge, because I do not believe that any AI systems do anything like this 
- Adaptation --> in a certain sense, measure of relative change 


Synapse, neurotransmitter, 
Inside: electrical || between: chemical

It seems extremely improbable to me that the 'point,' if you can even use that word, of human existence (a rational existence) is satiation of biological needs. Furthermore, it seems like one of the distinct human advantages is to be able to step back from the 'biological' and look at the 'purpose' or 'point.' 

It also seems like this ability is not alone in our brains, we are not purely rational creatures. We have these strange intelligence abilities but are still 'biologically bound' by primitive responses. For example, consider stress eating: 

> “ As far back as the first brains six hundred million years ago, the system for binge eating after a stressful experience was already put in place.” Nematodes stress eat. 


>[!wow]
>All the basic functions of human response, giving up, stress eating etc, can be found in nematodes. 

My claim here is that in addition to our 'rational' capabilities, we are very much still animals. 

What are we going to do? We are entering a new environment of our own creating, seems like we have to evolve, because thats how life works. 

*I know what I need to do: I need to rationally describe the things that I am going to choose to do in my life, make these decisions both considering, and stepping back from, the primitive biological realities of my existence.* 


AI thought: I am extremely skeptical that we will be able to build 'sentient' AI systems without all of these basic features of nematodes that exist in all other animals. Emotion. I think emotion can be simulated on a computer but not with a simple computer neural network. I need to learn some more neuroscience to figure out how it works, but I think our best bet is to 'simulate' things like neurotransmitters inside our computers. I have no doubt that AI systems will be able to preform nearly all non social tasks better than human beings, but they will lack the impetus to do anything without emotion. Wait.... maybe they don't need emotion. I doubt they will be 'sentient' then but they will still be competent. I also think that continual learning is important

Brain structures between vertebrates are extremely similar 

temporal credit assignment problem 
-- Temporal difference learning (actor and critic), expected utility 

Lackluster 

Dopamine is more about anticipation, and reinforcement. Dopamine release --> reinforces action.

Dopamine is TDL (Temporal Difference Learning):
>“The dopamine responses that Schultz found in monkeys aligned exactly with Sutton’s temporal difference learning signal. Dopamine neurons in Schultz’s monkeys got excited by predictive cues because these cues led to an increase in predicted future rewards (a positive temporal difference); dopamine neurons were unaffected by the delivery of an expected reward because there was no change in predicted future reward (no temporal difference); and dopamine-neuron activity decreased when expected rewards were omitted because there was a decrease in predicted future rewards (a negative temporal difference).”



*this is an important consideration in the DI curriculum*
Something very important: the differences in learning abilities between vertebrates and invertebrates. 
- Invertebrates: unable to learn precise time intervals 

Basal Ganglia 
Hypothalamus

This is a very good example to be able to point to. Some of the techniques used in AI today are modeled (accidentally or on purpose) off of biological systems. 
	EX: The connection between Temporal Difference Learning (TD-Learning), and the relationship between dopamine, the basal ganglia, and the Hypothalamus 
	EX: Convolutional Neural nets, picking up features of a particular image is analogous to how biological NNs do it.

supervised learning (nothing biological about supervised learning)

hebbian plasticity: 

auto association (especially for memory)

Biological Memory vs Computer Memory: 
B: content addressable memory (subset of memory --> full thing)
C: Register addressable memory (register --> automatically gives full thing)


Catastrophic interference --> this only happens in neural networks that are trying to encode memory. 

>[!cool idea]
>what would be really cool is if human beings were able to store additional memory in a register addressable memory, instead of just in our NN. 
>
>Memories could still be in terms of content addressable memory, in the sense that a central NN could remember part of something, and then it would tap into a frozen-in-time (or not overlapping) NN that holds the memory. 
>
>The exciting thing is that we are not bound by the same evolutionary biological constraints anymore, I don't see why we can't add more memory and computational power. We could just outsource it to tools that are specifically designed to preform computation of a particular sort. 
>
>The human brain becomes the client to an API of tools. 


>[!Warning]
>Crucial to AI development is going to be a sort of evolution of architectures. We need to consider how much 'training' biological creatures have gone through. Tens of millions of iterations of brain *architecture* and wiring, not just the specific connections between neurons, but certain parts of the brain, their function, and how they relate to each other.

Inductive bias!

It took explicitly programming in curiosity to beat the video game Montezuma's revenge in 2018, by rewarding finding new things. This is because there were no explicit rewards until very far in the game. I think this is what Elon is talking about.... An explicitly curious AI 
>“In vertebrates, surprise itself triggers the release of dopamine, even if there is no “real” reward. And yet, most invertebrates do not exhibit curiosity; only the most advanced invertebrates, such as insects and cephalopods, show curiosity, a trick that evolved independently and wasn’t present in early bilaterians.”


Suprising things are rewarding to vertebrates

Curiosity is an extremely valuable trait. You want to be maximally curious.

Learning by counterfactual. This seems to be pretty important in the human training process. Humans can literally simulate their own training data. 
- Reasoning about counterfactuals. 

Episodic memory vs Procedural memory 
- Episodic memory is a simulation of the past, if you want to remember something you need to create a simulation of it 

Repeatedly imagening things in a certain way increases the confidence in somebody that things really did happen this way 


TD learning does not preform well on more complex problems 

Run simulations in my mind constantly about scenarios --> this is what intelligent AIs do.

Brain is super complex with tons of different specialized regions working in synergy with each other. 

Ensemble learning 

Uncertainty --> simulation. If there is certainty there is not point of running a simulation.  This is so interesting. This seems super fundamental. Beyond just the internal mammalian brain running simulations, simulations have to do with uncertainty. We can certainly augment our intelligence. 


Training the basal ganglia vicariously to do the right thing. The basal ganglia does not know whether it is a simulation that it is taking in or the real world, but it is trained either way. Therefore, having a powerful simulation tool is extremely important. 

Disi Curriculum: 
- Include famous experiments, take note of the most important experiments, make a list and where they should fit in / observations about where things should go.

**Chapter 13:**
Vicarious learning of the Basal Ganglia 

Working Memory: “the maintenance of representations in the absence of any sensory cues.”

“These tasks require the aPFC because working memory functions in the same way as attention and planning—it is the invoking of an inner simulation. Working memory—holding something in your head—is just your aPFC trying to keep re-invoking an inner simulation until you no longer need it.”


There is a direct line of connection between the agranular Prefrontal Cortex and the Amygdala: 
“In moments of willpower, you can inhibit your amygdala-driven cravings. In moments of weakness, the amygdala wins. This is why people become more impulsive when tired or stressed—the aPFC is energetically expensive to run, so if you are tired or stressed, the aPFC will be much less effective at inhibiting the amygdala.”

**Chapter 14**

somatosensory Cortex 

microcircuitry of neocortical columns 


Karl Friston Friston's model that the motor cortex generates motor predictions 


“This is the general idea of “embodiment”—parts of the neocortex, such as the motor cortex and somatosensory cortex, have an entire model of an animal’s body that can be simulated, manipulated, and adjusted as time unfolds.”

Motor Cortex as needed for training: 

“his suggests that the motor cortex was originally not the locus of motor commands but of motor planning. When an animal must perform careful movements—placing a paw on a small platform or stepping over an out-of-sight obstacle—it must mentally plan and simulate its body movements ahead of time. This explains why the motor cortex is necessary for learning new complex movements but not for executing well-learned ones.”

**Mental Simulations are Key:**
“Mental rehearsal of motor skills substantially increases performance across speaking, golf swings, and even surgical maneuvers.”

Hierarchy of Goals
“How does all this work together? The frontal neocortex of early placental mammals was organized into a hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy was the agranular prefrontal cortex, where high-level goals are constructed based on amygdala and hypothalamus activation. The aPFC might generate an intent like “drink water” or “eat food.” The aPFC then propagates these goals to a nearby frontal region (the premotor cortex), which constructs subgoals and propagates these subgoals further until they reach the motor cortex, which then constructs sub-subgoals. The intent modeled in the motor cortex are these sub-subgoals, which can be as simple as “Position my index finger here and my thumb over here.”

This hierarchy of goals seems very important: 


“The primary new brain structure that emerged in early mammals was the neocortex. With the neocortex came the gift of simulation—the third breakthrough in our evolutionary story.”

other creatures have homologous structures to the neocortex, such as the dorsal cortex in repiles and birds have something called the wulst. 


“Sensory neocortex evolved, which created a simulation of the external world (a world model).
The agranular prefrontal cortex (aPFC) evolved, which was the first region of the frontal neocortex. The aPFC created a simulation of an animal’s own movements and internal states (a self model) and constructed “intent” to explain one’s own behavior.
The aPFC and sensory neocortex worked together to enable early mammals to pause and simulate aspects of the world that were not currently being experienced—in other words, model-based reinforcement learning.
The aPFC somehow solved the search problem by intelligently selecting paths to simulate and determining when to simulate them.
These simulations enabled early mammals to engage in vicarious trial and error—to simulate future actions and decide which path to take based on the imagined outcomes.”
“These simulations enabled early mammals to engage in episodic memory, which allowed mammals to recall past events and actions, and use these recollections to adjust their behavior.”

----
“This suggests that the granular prefrontal cortex plays a key role in your ability to project yourself—your intentions, feelings, thoughts, personality, and knowledge—into your rendered simulations, whether they are about the past or some imagined future. The simulations run in rat brains, which has no gPFC and only an aPFC and hippocampus, show evidence of rendering an external world, but there is nothing to suggest that they truly project any meaningful model of themselves into these simulations.”

***Pretty Important Exerpt:***
“The breakthrough of reinforcing enabled early vertebrates to learn from their own actual actions (trial and error). The breakthrough of simulating enabled early mammals to learn from their own imagined actions (vicarious trial and error). The breakthrough of mentalizing enabled early primates to learn from other people’s actual actions (imitation learning). But the breakthrough of speaking uniquely enabled early humans to learn from other people’s imagined actions.”

***Ideas Evolving Through an evolutionary Process Through Language:***

“This analogy of ideas evolving was proposed by Richard Dawkins in his famous book The Selfish Gene. He called these hopping ideas memes. This word was later appropriated for cat images and baby photos flying around Twitter, but he originally meant them to refer to an idea or behavior that spread from person to person in a culture.”

A Brief History of Intelligence


***Interesting Note On population decline -> loss of knowledge in Tasmania:***
“If groups don’t have writing, such distributed knowledge is sensitive to group size; if groups shrink, and there are no longer enough brains to fit all the information into, knowledge is lost. There is evidence that this occurred in societies in Tasmania. Archaeological evidence from eight thousand years ago shows that humans in Tasmania had complex knowledge of making bone tools, nets, fishing spears, boomerangs, and cold-weather clothing. All this knowledge was lost by the 1800s. This loss seems to have been initiated when rising oceans cut the group of humans in Tasmania off from other groups in the rest of Australia, effectively lowering the population size of the group of socially interacting humans. For people without writing, the smaller the population, the less knowledge can persist across generations.”



Now we invent automated algorithms that comb through our cumulative knowledge, so the interesting thing is when can they automate the synthesis of ideas together.

“We are the hive-brain apes. We synchronize our inner simulations, turning human cultures into a kind of meta-life-form whose consciousness is instantiated within the persistent ideas and thoughts flowing through millions of human brains over generations. The bedrock of this hive brain is our language.”
>[! IDea]
>it seems as if this 'hive mind' could be further enhanced by faster and more direct modes of communication.... such as brain to brain direct communication, rather than mediated through something else. 

Language --> allows for the evolution of ideas.

“Language transformed the human brain from an ephemeral organ to an eternal medium of accumulating inventions.”
