DI Plan: 
- Set up the philosophical questions related to intelligence, this should be done at the very beginning of the curriculum and these questions should constantly be referred to and thought aboutthroughout the curriculum. 

- Next we go through each of our categories and explore the different intelligences. 


I think I have to totally immerse myself in the discussion, and then save the things that I think are useful. 


Series of questions that each section addresses. 

Useful chapters from Animal Mind. One of the main resources. Then look back at all of the things that say DI on it that dad sent to me. 

Just compile resources for now. Then when we get to St. Andrew's we assemble the whole thing. 

Queue of things to mine out: 
1. Animal Mind 
2. Brief History of Intelligence 
3. Life 3.0 
4. Articles from dad 
5. Find other books and resources
