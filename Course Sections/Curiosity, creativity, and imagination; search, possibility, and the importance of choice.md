Curiosity, creativity, and imagination: search, possibility, and the importance of choice


Presentation on Curiosity: https://st-andrews.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=7ba4a02d-03ad-48c9-91ae-b1a100d6f565

**Curiosity is actually a rewarding thing in biological creatures, and people are attempting to program it into AI:**
It took explicitly programming in curiosity to beat the video game Montezuma's revenge in 2018, by rewarding finding new things. This is because there were no explicit rewards until very far in the game. I think this is what xAi is talking about.... An explicitly curious AI 
>“In vertebrates, surprise itself triggers the release of dopamine, even if there is no “real” reward. And yet, most invertebrates do not exhibit curiosity; only the most advanced invertebrates, such as insects and cephalopods, show curiosity, a trick that evolved independently and wasn’t present in early bilaterians.”


Suprising things are rewarding to vertebrates 

- Partly explains gambling and continuous scrolling ... Curious about one more item that is next
- Maybe horror movies as well!


***Important Thing to look into further:***
Repeatedly imagening things in a certain way increases the confidence in somebody that things really did happen this way
