- This is a very interesting article that explains it well.
- I think this is probably something that we want to show as one of the major shortcomings of AI, but we can also show how this is **NOT UNIQUE** to digital neural networks:

**What is a shortcut?**
In machine learning, the solutions that a model can learn are constrained by data, model architecture, optimizer and objective function. However, these constraints often don’t just allow for one single solution: there are typically many different ways to solve a problem. Shortcuts are solutions that perform well on a typical test set but fail under different circumstances, revealing a mismatch with our intentions.
