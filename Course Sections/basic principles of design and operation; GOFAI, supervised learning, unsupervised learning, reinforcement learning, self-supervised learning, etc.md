Important here to define the three main paradigms of machine learning: 
1. Reinforcement learning 
2. Supervised learning 
3. Unsupervised learning. 


I think it is also important to tie in connections to biological intelligence, and throughout the course drawn parallels between the two and also show how they area different: 
“The aPFC and sensory neocortex worked together to enable early mammals to pause and simulate aspects of the world that were not currently being experienced—in other words, model-based reinforcement learning.” -Excerpt From: A Brief History of Intelligence



Probably a good time to introduce the search problem in AI, how this might relate to what animals do.
