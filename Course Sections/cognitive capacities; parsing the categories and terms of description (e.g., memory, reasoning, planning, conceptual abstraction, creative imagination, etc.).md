***Questions of various definitions of intelligence:***
Despite the specific definition we use, seem to be common themes (memory, etc) and a gradation of abilities: 
>[! definitions of intelligence]
>Psychology Textbook: intelligence is the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new situations.
>
>Section on various definitions of intelligence:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence
==have each of the people we interview provide a definition of intelligence==













What we want to do here is simply to introduce these terms, show why they are relevant through preliminary examples, and explain how we are going to explore them more later.

***What is memory:*** 
“The memory in your brain works very differently from computer memory, not only in terms of how it’s built, but also in terms of how it’s used. Whereas you retrieve memories from a computer or hard drive by specifying where it’s stored, you retrieve memories from your brain by specifying something about what is stored. Each group of bits in your computer’s memory has a numerical address, and to retrieve a piece of information, the computer specifies at what address to look, just as if I tell you “Go to my bookshelf, take the fifth book from the right on the top shelf, and tell me what it says on here.” In contrast, you retrieve information from your brain similarly to how you retrieve it from a search engine: you specify a piece of the information or something related to it, and it pops up. If I tell you “to be or not,” or if I google it, chances are that it will trigger “To be, or not to be, that is the question.” Indeed, it will probably work even if I use another part of the quote or mess things up somewhat. Such memory systems are called auto-associative” as opposed to addressable memory.

**Important Distinction, and the distinction between register addressable memory in a computer:** 
Episodic memory vs Procedural memory 
- Episodic memory is a simulation of the past, if you want to remember something you need to create a simulation of it
