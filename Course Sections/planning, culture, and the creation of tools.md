Intelligence: Has the ability to see the potential in an object, not just the object itself.

"When you perceive intelligently, as you sometimes do, you always perceive a function, never an object in the set-theoretic or physical sense.” -- Stan Ulam
This is about the human capacity to imagine with an object, rather that just perceive it -- it is all about the meaning of an object 


***This could be a good place to talk about Mirror Neurons*** 
- Competing ideas as to what these are: Simply imagining oneself doing the action, Theory of Mind,
- Compelling evidence to suggest they activate when imagining the action, this can help us understand intentions 
- Also Crucial for imitation Learning

“When a primate watches another primate do an action, its premotor cortex often mirrors the actions it is observing.”
