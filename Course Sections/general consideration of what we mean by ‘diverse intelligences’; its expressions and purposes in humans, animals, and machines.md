***Why we have a brain in the first place:***
- Information processing unit
- Brains match stimuli with a response: 
	- Need more information processing once things get complex
	- When organisms need to search complex spaces, they need brains
- Predation:
	- Cambrian explosion -- 540 - 515 Mya
		- predation -- unpredictability 
- Most of the mammal life on the planet is domesticated 
	- Are humans domesticated? 
- Dogs likely evolved by eating scrap food from human camps 
	- Less threatening and dangerous dogs got closer to human camps and got more scraps 
		- this evolved them to be less aggressive 
- Do the transhumanists want to create more domesticated humans that get along with each other better  --[[Crafters]] -- [[Neoteny]]
- Traits evolved -- neoteny 
	- Smaller teeth
	- larger ears 
- Domestication syndrome 
- Domestication facilitates cooporation 
- Darwin's idea of "decent with modification" was greatly influenced by domestication of animals -- dogs for example, then he went to the Galapagos
