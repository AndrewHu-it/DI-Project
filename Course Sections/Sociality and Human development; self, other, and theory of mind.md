Comic-strip task devised by Eric Brunet-Gouet in 2000


“Brunet-Gouet performed a PET scan of the subjects’ brains while they did this comic-strip task. He found an interesting difference in which brain regions got excited by each type of comic strip. When asked about comic strips that required understanding the intentions of the characters, but not when asked about other types of comic strips, these uniquely primate areas of neocortex, like gPFC, lit up with activation.
In addition to inferring other people’s intent, these primate areas also get activated by tasks that require inferring other people’s knowledge.”

***Sall-Ann Marble Test*** -- false-belief tests

“Humans pass such false-belief tests by the age of four.”

“If we revisit our mysterious patients with granular prefrontal damage and test them for theory-of-mind tasks, we begin to see a common theme emerge from their seemingly disparate, subtle, and bizarre symptoms. Such patients are worse at solving false-belief tests like the Sally-Ann test; they are much worse at recognizing emotions in other people; they struggle to empathize with other people’s emotions, struggle to distinguish lies from jokes, struggle to identify a faux pas that would offend someone, struggle to take someone else’s visual perspective, and struggle to deceive others.”

***Simulation Theory/ Social Projection Theory*** 
- Original Formulations with Plato: 
	- “first understand our own minds and then use this understanding of ourselves to understand others.”
- “When we try to understand why someone else did something, we do so by imagining ourselves in their situation”
- EVIDENCE: How children develop their sense of self.






***Theory of mind is Crucial for teaching:*** 

“Teaching is possible only with theory of mind. Teaching requires understanding what another mind does not know and what demonstrations would help manipulate another mind’s knowledge in the correct way. While it is still controversial whether any primates other than humans teach, in recent years evidence is beginning to accumulate in favor of the idea that nonhuman primates do, in fact, actively teach one another.”

“There are three broad abilities that seem to have emerged in early primates:

**Theory of mind:** inferring intent and knowledge of others
**Imitation learning:** acquiring novel skills through observation
**Anticipating future needs:** taking an action now to satisfy a want in the future, even though I do not want it now”
“These may not, in fact, have been separate abilities but rather emergent properties of a single new breakthrough: the construction of a generative model of one’s own mind, a trick that can be called “mentalizing.”
