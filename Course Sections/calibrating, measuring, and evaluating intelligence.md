History of IQ 
Turing Test (AI)

Distinction between two types of intelligence tests in Psychology: 
**Achievement tests:** which are intended to reflect what you have learned. Your final
exam will measure what you learned in this class.
**Aptitude tests:** which are intended to predict what you will be able to learn. If you took an
entrance exam, it was designed to predict your ability to do college or university work.

>[! idea]
>it seems to me that this might be a useful distinction in evaluating AI... If we use it for humans, why not AI systems?
