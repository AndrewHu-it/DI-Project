***Around that time that children are able to pass the mirror test:*** 
“It is also around this time that children begin to exhibit a primitive understanding of mental states and begin to use words like want, wish, and pretend. It is later, around the age of three, when children realize they can hold their own false beliefs; they are able to make statements such as “I thought it was an alligator. Now I know it’s a crocodile.” It isn’t until after this point, around the age of four or five, when children pass false-belief tests, such as the Sally-Ann test, with respect to other people.”
