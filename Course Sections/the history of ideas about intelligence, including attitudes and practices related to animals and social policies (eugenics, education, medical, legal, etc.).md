Aristotle's *reason*: Humans had reason, animals did not 

Darwin explored the notion that this 'reason' has a gradation across animals. It is not an all or none thing. He called them "Mental powers"

This is something pretty easy to flush out. 


***History of Categorizing Human Intelligence:***
Many attempts before the 'IQ' test. 
French psychologist [Alfred Binet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Binet "Alfred Binet"), together with Victor Henri and [Théodore Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Simon "Théodore Simon"), had more success in 1905, when they published the [Binet–Simon test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford%E2%80%93Binet_Intelligence_Scales "Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales"),

- Intelligent Quotient Test 
It was intended to identify "mental retardation" in school children,

[[general factor (_g_)]]

During world war 1, they implimented intelligence screening:

fter the war, positive publicity promoted by army psychologists helped to make psychology a respected field. Subsequently, there was an increase in jobs and funding in psychology in the United States. Group intelligence tests were developed and became widely used in schools and industry

**The Cattell- Horn- Carroll (CHC)**
theory brings all of these abilities together in one cumulative framework, affirming
a general intellectual ability factor and the existence of Gf and Gc.

***HISTORY OF MEASURING HUMAN INTELLIGENCE:***
***Francis Galton:*** Came up with the phrase Nature and Nurture, and attempted to implement the first intelligence tests or assessments 

***Alfred Binet:***
Thus, their goal became measuring each child’s mental age, the level of performance
typically associated with a certain chronological age.
Binet and Simon made no assumptions concerning why a particular child was slow,
average, or precocious.
self-discipline. He believed his intelligence test did not measure inborn intelligence as a scale measures weight. Rather, it had a single practical purpose: to identify French schoolchildren needing special attention. Binet hoped his test would be used to improve children’s education, but he also feared it would be used to label children and limit their opportunities

The intelligence quotient (IQ) was a formula developed by German psychologist William Stern. **This was its original Idea:**
$IQ = \frac{mental\ age}{chronological\ age}$
But now it is different and arbitrarily set to 100: 
Instead, they assign a score that represents a test-taker’s performance relative to the average performance (arbitrarily set at 100) of others the same age. Most people—about 68 percent of those taking an intelligence test—fall between 85 and 115. 15 = 1 standard deviation 

Notions of Eugenics... With Terman’s help, the U.S. government developed new tests to evaluate both newly arriving immigrants and World War I army recruits — the world’s first mass administration of an intelligence test.
