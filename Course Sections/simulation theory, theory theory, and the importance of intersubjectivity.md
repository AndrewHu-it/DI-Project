Social Brain Hypothesis: 
The bigger the neocortex --> the bigger the social group
This correlation does not hold for non mammals

Living in groups: why it came about, but it also has downsides that needed evolutionary mechanisms to mitigate: 

“However, group living is not a freely gained survival benefit—it comes at a high cost. In the presence of food constraints or limited numbers of eligible mates, a herd of animals creates dangerous competition. If this competition leads to infighting and violence, the group ends up wasting precious energy competing and fighting each other. In such a circumstance, the same number of animals would have been better off living separately.
Thus, animals who fell into the strategy of group living evolved tools to resolve disputes while minimizing the energetic cost of such disputes. This led to the development of mechanisms to signal strength and submission without having to actually engage in a physical altercation. Deer and antelope lock horns to compete for food and mates, a much cheaper form of competition than fighting. Bears, monkeys, and dogs bare their teeth and growl to show aggression.”

“With the ability to signal strength and submission, many animals were able to make group living work. Most lineages of mammals fell into one of four buckets of social systems: solitary, pair-bonded, harems, and multi-male groups.”

“When Menzel first revealed the location of hidden food to one of the subordinate chimpanzees, named Belle, she happily alerted the rest of the group and shared the food. But when the dominate male, Rock, came over to indulge in the treat, he took all the food for himself. After Rock did this a few times, Belle stopped sharing, and began engaging in ever more sophisticated strategies to withhold information about the hidden locations of food from Rock.
At first, Belle simply sat on top of the secret location of the food to hide it from Rock, and only when he was far away would she uncover and openly eat the food. But when Rock realized she was hiding the food underneath her, he began pushing her to get at the food. In response to this, Belle came up with a new strategy—once she was shown a new location for the hidden food, she didn’t go to it immediately. She would wait for Rock to look away, and then she would run to the food. In response to this new strategy, Rock began trying to trick Belle: He would look away and act uninterested, and once Belle went[…]”


“This process of ever-escalating deceptions and counter-deceptions reveals that both Rock and Belle were able to understand the other’s intent”

**THEORY OF MIND:** 

“This act of inferring someone’s intent and knowledge is called “theory of mind”—so named because it requires us to have a theory about the minds of others.”
