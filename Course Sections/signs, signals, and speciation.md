“All languages have the formal and expressive power to communicate the
ideas, beliefs, and desires of their users”
Li & Gleitman (2002)
______
The categories and types that we isolate from the world ...
we do not find there because they stare every observer in
the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a
kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organized
by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic
systems in our minds...

- Whorf, 1940/1956 Science and Linguistics
___
Human beings create categories, they do not exist in the physical space 

____
**Key Idea:** Having words for things allows us to offload lots of mental cognition to new words with particular meanings. 

“We don’t have to think about a hundred as “ten tens”
when doing mental arithmetic, or aunt as “mother’s
sister, or father’s sister, or father’s brother’s wife, or
mother’s brother’s wife” when greeting Aunt Mathilda.
Composing complex concepts gives enormous power
to our mental computations, and most of those
complex concepts are inherited from the language we
happen to speak. (Levinson, 2003, p. 56)

Our vocabulary provides us with readymade cognitive “chunks” that we
can readily deploy in communication and in individual problem solving.
Language enhances categorization, providing a categorical overlay over the world of percepts. ---> ...greater conceptual alignment
(Gary Lupyan )

- Could it be that LLMs are doing the same thing? They are merely exploiting the structures and correlation in the english language 


**FOR DECLARATIVE  SYMBOLS:** As contrasted with imperative lebels
Recognizing that human language is not hardwired from birth ( unlike virtually all other animals) but a cultural synthesis: 
“Human language differs from other forms of animal communication in two ways. First, no other known form of naturally occurring animal communication assigns declarative labels (otherwise known as symbols). A human teacher will point to an object or a behavior and assign it an arbitrary label: elephant, tree, running. In contrast, other animals’ communications are genetically hardwired and not assigned. Vervet monkey and chimpanzee gestures are almost identical across different groups that have no contact with each other. Monkeys and apes deprived of social contact still use the same gestures. In fact, these gestures are even shared across species of primates; bonobos and chimpanzees share almost exactly the same repertoire of gestures and vocalizations. In nonhuman primates, the meanings of these gestures and vocalizations is not assigned through declarative labeling but emerge directly from genetic hardwiring.”


*“When I hear stay, if I stop moving, I will get a treat.” This is basic temporal difference learning—all vertebrates can do this. Declarative labeling, on the other hand, is a special feature of human language. A declarative label is one that assigns an object or behavior an arbitrary symbol—“That is a cow,” “That is running,”—without any imperative at all. No other form of naturally occurring animal communication has been found to do this.”*

Language: Incredibly broad set of inner thoughts 

“All these practical benefits emerge from the fact that language expands the scope of sources a brain can extract learnings from.”

***Pretty Important Exerpt:***
“The breakthrough of reinforcing enabled early vertebrates to learn from their own actual actions (trial and error). The breakthrough of simulating enabled early mammals to learn from their own imagined actions (vicarious trial and error). The breakthrough of mentalizing enabled early primates to learn from other people’s actual actions (imitation learning). But the breakthrough of speaking uniquely enabled early humans to learn from other people’s imagined actions.”
