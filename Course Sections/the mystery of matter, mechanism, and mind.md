Here, we can set up a lot of the major philosophical questions.

>[!Mind-Body Problem]
> What is the relationship between the human mind and the human body? Thought and Consciousness
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem

> Clearly there is an essential link between the two: "Feelings of pain (in the mind) cause avoidance behaviors (in the body), and so on." The same thing goes for drugs. 
> 
> The seemingly abstract mental states that we hold have physical consequences


>[!Qualia]
>The question hinges on whether color is a product of the mind or an inherent property of objects. Qualia are instances of subjective conscious experience
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia

**Though Experiment:**
>Another way to look at this question is to assume two people ("Fred" and "George" for the sake of convenience) see colors differently. That is, when Fred sees the sky, his mind interprets this light signal as blue. He calls the sky "blue." However, when George sees the sky, his mind assigns green to that light frequency. If Fred were able to step into George's mind, he would be amazed that George saw green skies. However, George has learned to associate the word "blue" with what his mind sees as green, and so he calls the sky "blue", because for him the color green has the name "blue."


[[Hard Problem of Consciousness]]

>[!Hard Problem of Consciousness]
>why and how humans and other organisms have qualia, phenomenal consciousness, or subjective experience

>Contrasted with 'Easy Problems' of explaining why and how humans discriminate, to integrate information, and to perform behavioral functions such as watching, listening, speaking. These can be explained by 'mechanism' or functional explanation. 

- This is the right place to start talking about consciousness I think. Maybe explore different theories of consciousness. 
- (One interesting theory of Consciousness) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory




>[!Cognition and AI]
>What even is Intelligence? How do we even define consciousness? And importantly, how can an observer test for these criteria?
