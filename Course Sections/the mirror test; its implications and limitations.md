“Damage to the granular prefrontal cortex may also affect people’s models of themselves not only in their mental simulations, but also in the present. Some people with gPFC damage develop mirror-sign syndrome, a condition in which they no longer recognize themselves in a mirror. These patients insist that the people they see in a mirror are not them. Your modeling of your own mind in the present and the mind you project in your imagination seem to be intimately related.”

***Mirror Test as Related to Theory of Mind:***
- “Evidence for social projection theory can also be found in how children develop their sense of self. The childhood development of a sense of self is highly related to the childhood development of theory of mind. One way to test a child’s sense of self is the mirror self-recognition test. Put a smudge of something on a child’s face, let him look in the mirror, and see if he touches that part of his face, realizing that he is seeing himself. Children don’t tend to pass this test until they are about two years old.”
